# Face Recognition - GRACE benchmarking dataset

## Description

The selected corpus for this benchmark is VGGFace2, which is a large-scale face recognition dataset that includes face images exhibiting substantial variations in pose, age, illumination, ethnicity, and profession. 
The original dataset included over 9,000 distinct identities and over 3.3 million faces.

We processed the test set from VGGFace2 to ensure a balanced representation of gender and age groups, while preserving the nature of the ``in the wild" corpus, which aligns with the CSEM domain.
The dataset was age- and gender-balanced. The age group covers pre-pubescent, pubescent, and adults
