# Scene Text Recognition - GRACE benchmarking dataset

## Description

The benchmark dataset for scene text recognition is created to evaluate models trained to differentiate between images containing or lacking text, 
allowing text-bearing images to be further analysed using optical character recognition (OCR). The ICDAR2019 dataset was employed as the source data, 
as it includes a broad spectrum of languages and text sizes.
The GRACE benchmark corpus is then composed by images with text in various languages/alphabets, text formats, and sizes. 
This variety enables trained models to effectively identify and classify text in real-world scenarios, where text may appear in different languages or formats.
